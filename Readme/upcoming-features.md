**Upcoming Features**

I am working to improve this Inventory System and add new features to make it even more versatile. Here’s what’s coming soon:

1. **Crafting System**:
    - A built-in crafting system that allows players to combine items to create new ones.
    - Customizable recipes and crafting stations.
2. **Tool to Manage All Inventories in One Place**:
    - A centralized editor tool to view and manage all inventories in your project.
    - Easily edit inventory settings, add/remove items, and test functionality without entering Play Mode.
3. **Item Collection System**:
    - A system to track and reward players for collecting specific items.
    - Perfect for achievement systems or quests that require item collection.
