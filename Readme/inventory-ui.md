**Inventory UI :**

- You can open ‘Inventory UI Setup’ window from Tools<Inventory to help you setup the Inventory UI.

The Inventory System supports two types of UI setups: **Dynamic Inventory UI** and **Static Inventory UI**. Each has its own settings and use cases, depending on your game's requirements.
