**INVENTORY SYSTEM**

A modular and easy-to-use Inventory System for Unity based on Scriptable Objects.

This system is designed to let designers and developers easily create and manage inventory systems without writing code. It provides powerful tools to create items, inventories, and UI setups directly from the Unity Editor.

**Features:**

- **Stackable Items**: Items can be stacked in the inventory, allowing multiple quantities of the same item in a single slot.
- **Item Categories**: Items can be categorized (e.g., weapons, consumables, armor), and slots can be restricted to specific categories.
- **Save/Load Functionality**: Inventory data can be saved and loaded, ensuring persistence across game sessions.
- **Trading System**: Players can buy and sell items with merchants.
- **Chest System**: Store items in chests with automatic save/load functionality.
- **Editor Tools**: Easy-to-use tools for setting up inventories, items, and UI without writing code.
