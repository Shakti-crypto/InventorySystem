**Item Database:**

Item Database is a Scriptable-Object that contains element IDs. These IDs are needed to fetch items in the Inventory.

**The package comes with an Item Database.** You don’t need to create one additionally. One project needs only one Item database. But, still if you want to create a new one:

**How to Create**

- Right-click in the Project Window > Create > Inventory > Item Database
- Place the database inside Resources/InventorySystem folder.

**Important Notes**

- Each item must have a unique Item ID.
- Don’t forget to add items to the database after creating one.
- If you create items using the Item Creator Window, they will automatically be added to the database.
